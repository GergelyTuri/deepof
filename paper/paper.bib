	abstract = {Aberrant social behavior is a core feature of many neuropsychiatric disorders, yet the study of complex social behavior in freely moving rodents is relatively infrequently incorporated into preclinical models. This likely contributes to limited translational impact. A major bottleneck for the adoption of socially complex, ethology-rich, preclinical procedures are the technical limitations for consistently annotating detailed behavioral repertoires of rodent social behavior. Manual annotation is subjective, prone to observer drift, and extremely time-intensive. Commercial approaches are expensive and inferior to manual annotation. Open-source alternatives often require significant investments in specialized hardware and significant computational and programming knowledge. By combining recent computational advances in convolutional neural networks and pose-estimation with further machine learning analysis, complex rodent social behavior is primed for inclusion under the umbrella of computational neuroethology.Here we present an open-source package with graphical interface and workflow (Simple Behavioral Analysis, SimBA) that uses pose-estimation to create supervised machine learning predictive classifiers of rodent social behavior, with millisecond resolution and accuracies that can out-perform human observers. SimBA does not require specialized video acquisition hardware nor extensive computational background. Standard descriptive statistical analysis, along with graphical region of interest annotation, are provided in addition to predictive classifier generation. To increase ease-of-use for behavioural neuroscientists, we designed SimBA with accessible menus for pre-processing videos, annotating behavioural training datasets, selecting advanced machine learning options, robust classifier validation functions and flexible visualizations tools. This allows for predictive classifier transparency, explainability and tunability prior to, and during, experimental use. We demonstrate that this approach is flexible and robust in both mice and rats by classifying social behaviors that are commonly central to the study of brain function and social motivation. Finally, we provide a library of poseestimation weights and behavioral predictive classifiers for resident-intruder behaviors in mice and rats. All code and data, together with detailed tutorials and documentation, are available on the SimBA GitHub repository.Graphical abstract SimBA graphical interface (GUI) for creating supervised machine learning classifiers of rodent social behavior.(a) Pre-process videos. SimBA supports common video pre-processing functions (e.g., cropping, clipping, sampling, format conversion, etc.) that can be performed either on single videos, or as a batch.(b) Managing poseestimation data and creating classification projects. Pose-estimation tracking projects in DeepLabCut and DeepPoseKit can be either imported or created and managed within the SimBA graphical user interface, and the tracking results are imported into SimBA classification projects.SimBA also supports userdrawn region-of-interests (ROIs) for descriptive statistics of animal movements, or as features in machine learning classification projects.(c) Create classifiers, perform classifications, and analyze classification data. SimBA has graphical tools for correcting poseestimation tracking inaccuracies when multiple subjects are within a single frame, annotating behavioral events from videos, and optimizing machine learning hyperparameters and discrimination thresholds. A number of validation checkpoints and logs are included for increased classifier explainability and tunability prior to, and during, experimental use. Both detailed and summary data are provided at the end of classifier analysis. SimBA accepts behavioral annotations generated elsewhere (such as through JWatcher) that can be imported into SimBA classification projects.(d) Visualize classification results. SimBA has several options for visualizing machine learning classifications, animal movements and ROI data, and analyzing the durations and frequencies of classified behaviors.See the SimBA GitHub repository for a comprehensive documentation and user tutorials.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Severe stress exposure is a global problem with long-lasting negative behavioral and physiological consequences, increasing the risk of stress-related disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD). An essential characteristic of MDD is the impairment of social functioning and lack of social motivation. Chronic social defeat stress is an established animal model for MDD research, which induces a cascade of physiological and social behavioral changes. The current developments of markerless pose estimation tools allow for more complex and socially relevant behavioral tests, but the application of these tools to social behavior remains to be explored. Here, we introduce the open-source tool {\textquotedblleft}DeepOF{\textquotedblright} to investigate the individual and social behavioral profile in mice by providing supervised and unsupervised pipelines using DeepLabCut annotated pose estimation data. The supervised pipeline relies on pre-trained classifiers to detect defined traits for both single and dyadic animal behavior. Subsequently, the unsupervised pipeline explores the behavioral repertoire of the animals without label priming, which has the potential of pointing towards previously unrecognized motion motifs that are systematically different across conditions. We here provide evidence that the DeepOF supervised and unsupervised pipelines detect a distinct stress-induced social behavioral pattern, which was particularly observed at the beginning of a novel social encounter. The stress-induced social behavior shows a state of arousal that fades with time due to habituation. In addition, while the classical social avoidance task does identify the stress-induced social behavioral differences, both DeepOF behavioral pipelines provide a clearer and more detailed profile. DeepOF aims to facilitate reproducibility and unification of behavioral classification of social behavior by providing an open-source tool, which can significantly advance the study of rodent individual and social behavior, thereby enabling novel biological insights as well as drug development for psychiatric disorders.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The study of naturalistic social behavior requires quantification of animals' interactions. This is generally done through manual annotation---a highly time-consuming and tedious process. Recent advances in computer vision enable tracking the pose (posture) of freely behaving animals. However, automatically and accurately classifying complex social behaviors remains technically challenging. We introduce the Mouse Action Recognition System (MARS), an automated pipeline for pose estimation and behavior quantification in pairs of freely interacting mice. We compare MARS's annotations to human annotations and find that MARS's pose estimation and behavior classification achieve human-level performance. We also release the pose and annotation datasets used to train MARS to serve as community benchmarks and resources. Finally, we introduce the Behavior Ensemble and Neural Trajectory Observatory (BENTO), a graphical user interface for analysis of multimodal neuroscience datasets. Together, MARS and BENTO provide an end-to-end pipeline for behavior data extraction and analysis in a package that is user-friendly and easily modifiable.},

	abstract = {Keypoint tracking algorithms have revolutionized the analysis of animal behavior, enabling investigators to flexibly quantify behavioral dynamics from conventional video recordings obtained in a wide variety of settings. However, it remains unclear how to parse continuous keypoint data into the modules out of which behavior is organized. This challenge is particularly acute because keypoint data is susceptible to high frequency jitter that clustering algorithms can mistake for transitions between behavioral modules. Here we present keypoint-MoSeq, a machine learning-based platform for identifying behavioral modules ({\textquotedblleft}syllables{\textquotedblright}) from keypoint data without human supervision. Keypoint-MoSeq uses a generative model to distinguish keypoint noise from behavior, enabling it to effectively identify syllables whose boundaries correspond to natural sub-second discontinuities inherent to mouse behavior. Keypoint-MoSeq outperforms commonly-used alternative clustering methods at identifying these transitions, at capturing correlations between neural activity and behavior, and at classifying either solitary or social behaviors in accordance with human annotations. Keypoint-MoSeq therefore renders behavioral syllables and grammar accessible to the many researchers who use standard video to capture animal behavior.Competing Interest StatementSRD sits on the scientific advisory boards of Neumora, Inc and Gilgamesh Therapeutics},

	abstract = {A popular approach to quantifying animal behavior from video data is through discrete behavioral segmentation, wherein video frames are labeled as containing one or more behavior classes such as walking or grooming. Sequence models learn to map behavioral features extracted from video frames to discrete behaviors, and both supervised and unsupervised methods are common. However, each approach has its drawbacks: supervised models require a time-consuming annotation step where humans must hand label the desired behaviors; unsupervised models may fail to accurately segment particular behaviors of interest. We introduce a semi-supervised approach that addresses these challenges by constructing a sequence model loss function with (1) a standard supervised loss that classifies a sparse set of hand labels; (2) a weakly supervised loss that classifies a set of easy-to-compute heuristic labels; and (3) a self-supervised loss that predicts the evolution of the behavioral features. With this approach, we show that a large number of unlabeled frames can improve supervised segmentation in the regime of sparse hand labels and also show that a small number of hand labeled frames can increase the precision of unsupervised segmentation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

To this end, supervised or unsupervised methods are chosen based upon their intrinsic strengths and weaknesses (e.g. user bias, training cost, complexity, action discovery). Here, a new active learning platform, A-SOiD, blends these strengths and in doing so, overcomes several of their inherent drawbacks. A-SOiD iteratively learns user-defined groups with a fraction of the usual training data while attaining expansive classification through directed unsupervised classification. In socially-interacting mice, A-SOiD outperformed standard methods despite requiring 85\% less training data. Additionally, it isolated two additional ethologically-distinct mouse interactions via unsupervised classification. Similar performance and efficiency was observed using non-human primate 3D pose data. In both cases, the transparency in A-SOiD{\textquoteright}s cluster definitions revealed the defining features of the supervised classification through a game-theoretic approach.
